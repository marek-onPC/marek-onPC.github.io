        <p>Hi! I am Marek, a Frontend Developer interested in web dev technologies, mainly in practical use of JavaScript with JS frameworks, and some back-end dev with PHP.</p>
        <p>This website is my side project to collect useful information with which I came across during my personal and commercial work, and save it in a form of easily accessible notes.</p>
        <p>My main project though, on which I am mainly working during my spare time, is a WordPress Gutenberg extension plugin called Gutenberg Plus, which allows user to use new useful blocks in WordPress main content editor â€“ Gutenberg.
          Plugin is created by using JSX syntax known from React, with an environment based on NPM and Gulp toolkit.</p>
